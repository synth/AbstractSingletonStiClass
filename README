#
# This module allows you to make parent classes of STI abstract only, and must be derived off of.
# 
# requires the 'acts_as_singleton' gem
#
# also, checks that there is a corresponding row in the database(if not abstract)
# a class becomes "abstract" automatically if it is subclassed
#
# For the database check to work, there must be at least one validation on the model
# so the first || create call in acts_as_singleton will fail and return an unsaved object
